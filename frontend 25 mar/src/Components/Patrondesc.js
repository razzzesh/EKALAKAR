            <strong>How Patron helps artist to make business </strong>
          </h2>
          <p class="h5 mt-3" data-aos="fade-up">
            When it comes to sponsoring the arts, corporate partnerships are a
            mainstay. Many believe that companies engage in this type of support
            because of the fundamental value that the arts bring to a community.
            However, the reasoning behind corporate sponsorship of the arts goes
            far beyond just that goal. When a company invests in the arts, it is
            in fact working toward ensuring its own financial health and success
            as a business. At the end of the day, sponsoring the arts builds
            business. Let's take a look at how this works.
          </p>
          <ul
            class="text-start h5 mt-3"

              <strong>Financial Impact Of The Arts.</strong>
            </li>
            <p class="h5" data-aos="fade-up">
              To understand how the arts and cultural industries build business
              in their communities, we need to have a good understanding of the
              financial impact of the arts. According to a report, U.S. arts and
              cultural economic activity had impressive growth in 2016, adding
              about $60 billion more to the U.S. economy than the construction
              industry added. In the same year, the arts industry contributed
              nearly five times more to the American economy than the
              agricultural sector did. Those facts alone should be eye-openers,
              but add to that the realization that the $804 billion the arts
              contributed to the U.S. GDP in 2016 is more than half of the
              entire GDP of Canada or Russia. The GDP for Canada was $1.536
              trillion in 2016, while in Russia it stood at $1.285 trillion.
              What’s more, the financial impact of the arts on the U.S. economy
              is more than the entire 2016 GDP for countries such as Saudi
              Arabia ($645 billion), Switzerland ($669 billion) or the
              Netherlands ($777 billion). It’s been said that the arts mean big
              business, but the facts show that the arts mean huge business.

              Community leaders have been leveraging the economic power of the
              arts and creative industries to revitalize rural communities. The
              National Governors Association, working in partnership with
              national arts agencies, published "Rural Prosperity Through the
              Arts & Creative Sector: A Rural Action Guide for Governors and
              States" to help rural communities overcome economic challenges
              specific to their areas, such as outmigration, lack of educational
              opportunities and lack of infrastructure. The guidebook provides
              suggestions for helping these communities thrive by offering
              action plans that assist them in growing and harnessing their own
              arts and cultural assets. Just to sum that up: The National
              Governors Association is giving states proven strategies for
              economically disadvantaged rural areas that will build businesses
              and create economic opportunities to thrive by partnering with the
              arts.

              Public art installations have been used in beautification programs
              for cities and towns. They are not just an important part of a
              plan to make the areas look better; they can also boost a city's
              growth. The more a city has to offer, the more competitive it will
              be in attracting conventions and employers. Public art adds to the
              walkability of a city around event centers and helps make the city
              more distinguished in the eyes of meeting and event planners.
              Public art has a direct impact on not only how visitors view a
              city, but how residents view it. According to a public opinion
              survey, 60% of participants believe that the "arts improve the
              image and identity" of their community. Leveraging public art and
              cultural corridors to attract events also helps local businesses
              profit when those events do come to town. The survey also shows
              that people perceive the arts as having a vital role in driving
              the health and the prosperity of a community. This example shows
              that arts and cultural organizations truly have the ability to
              build communities and add significantly to their overall
              stability, wealth and resources. Promoting the arts can also
              affect companies that support these organizations by impacting
              their bottom line in a positive way. Corporate Visionaries Lead
              The Way In 2018, North American sponsorship in the arts broke the
              $1 billion mark for the first time. The No. 1 business sector
              supporting the arts was the banking industry. After the banking
              industry, the next two biggest sponsors of the arts were
              professional services and financial services. These categories
              include, but are not limited to, professions such as lawyers,
              management consultants, investment brokers and accounting firms.
              The fourth-largest industry sponsoring the arts was the insurance
              industry. These industries are not supporting the arts solely to
              give back to the community. They also do it because their work
              with these cultural organizations has a positive impact on their
              own business and company culture. As I wrote in a previous
              article, companies today are increasingly rated by their community
              involvement, ethics and social responsibility. Many corporate
              visionaries see the value of deeper cultural engagement and being
              connected to the community. Such engagement opens the
              opportunities for companies to stand out in the eyes of consumers,
              employees and investors. It’s also a way to stand out from the
              competition. Partnerships with the arts not only help support the
              community, but they are also smart, proactive steps to building
              better business.
