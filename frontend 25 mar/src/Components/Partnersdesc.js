                Artists are important for several reasons. They provide a way of
                understanding and interpreting the world around us. They allow
                us to see the world from a different perspective and to
                appreciate the beauty in things that we might otherwise
                overlook. Artists help us to see the world differently. They
                offer new perspectives and ways of looking at familiar things.
                Their work can challenge our assumptions and open our eyes to
                new possibilities. Artists can also help us to understand
                ourselves better. Their work often reflects the human condition
                and can provide insight into our own emotions and experiences.
                By looking at the world through an artist’s eyes, we can gain a
                new understanding and how we all fit into the world around us.
                Artists often challenge the status quo and push us to think
                outside the box. They can bring change in the world by giving us
                a new way of looking at things. Infact, many of the most
                remarkable changes in history have been brought in by artists.
                Artists connect us to our history. They help us to understand
                who we are and where we come from.Their work records our past
                and a window into our future. They leave a legacy for future
                generations. The artwork left by our ancestors can give us a
                glimpse into their lives and how they saw the world. It can help
                us to understand our own culture and traditions.
