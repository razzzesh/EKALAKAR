                <p class="h5" data-aos="fade-up">
                  Artists are important for several reasons. They provide a way
                  of understanding and interpreting the world around us. They
                  allow us to see the world from a different perspective and to
                  appreciate the beauty in things that we might otherwise
                  overlook. Artists help us to see the world differently. They
                  offer new perspectives and ways of looking at familiar things.
                  Their work can challenge our assumptions and open our eyes to
                  new possibilities. Artists can also help us to understand
                  ourselves better. Their work often reflects the human
                  condition and can provide insight into our own emotions and
                  experiences. By looking at the world through an artist’s eyes,
                  we can gain a new understanding and how we all fit into the
                  world around us. Artists often challenge the status quo and
                  push us to think outside the box. They can bring change in the
                  world by giving us a new way of looking at things. Infact,
                  many of the most remarkable changes in history have been
                  brought in by artists. Artists connect us to our history. They
                  help us to understand who we are and where we come from.Their
                  work records our past and a window into our future. They leave
                  a legacy for future generations. The artwork left by our
                  ancestors can give us a glimpse into their lives and how they
                  saw the world. It can help us to understand our own culture
                  and traditions.

                  <p class="h5" data-aos="fade-up">
                    Funding can be a primary issue within the arts, and if
                    you’re financially able, do consider donating. By making a
                    donation to your local arts charity or fund, you can
                    contribute to the support of artists and arts organisations
                    immensely. Such gestures can aid this industry by providing
                    individuals and smaller institutions with the resources they
                    need for artistic production, programming, residencies,
                    exhibitions, and much more.

                  <p class="h5" data-aos="fade-up">
                    A major way to support the arts is to regularly attend
                    exhibitions and openings at your local galleries. However,
                    as many of us carry out social distancing measures during
                    this time, many arts institutions and galleries have moved
                    their exhibitions online through virtual galleries and
                    online viewing rooms. Showing up to an exhibition - even
                    virtually - can be a very cultural and educational
                    experience. It also goes a long way to showcase support to
                    your fellow local artists and arts community. Google Arts
                    and Culture features content from over 2,000 leading museums
                    and galleries on their platform. They have also partnered
                    with various institutions to showcase their exhibitions
                    online, where you can even view and virtually enter some of
                    the most prestigious museums around the world - right from
                    your own living room. Check them out here. Art fairs and
                    festivals are even moving online, such as the Virtual Design
                    Festival. Launching on 15 April, this will be the very first
                    online architecture and design festival that will include
                    contributions from major designers, instututions and brands
                    around the world.

                Artists are important for several reasons. They provide a way of
                understanding and interpreting the world around us. They allow
                us to see the world from a different perspective and to
                appreciate the beauty in things that we might otherwise
                overlook. Artists help us to see the world differently. They
                offer new perspectives and ways of looking at familiar things.
                Their work can challenge our assumptions and open our eyes to
                new possibilities. Artists can also help us to understand
                ourselves better. Their work often reflects the human condition
                and can provide insight into our own emotions and experiences.
                By looking at the world through an artist’s eyes, we can gain a
                new understanding and how we all fit into the world around us.
                Artists often challenge the status quo and push us to think
                outside the box. They can bring change in the world by giving us
                a new way of looking at things. Infact, many of the most
                remarkable changes in history have been brought in by artists.
                Artists connect us to our history. They help us to understand
                who we are and where we come from.Their work records our past
                and a window into our future. They leave a legacy for future
                generations. The artwork left by our ancestors can give us a
                glimpse into their lives and how they saw the world. It can help
                us to understand our own culture and traditions.

                  Funding can be a primary issue within the arts, and if you’re
                  financially able, do consider donating. By making a donation
                  to your local arts charity or fund, you can contribute to the
                  support of artists and arts organisations immensely. Such
                  gestures can aid this industry by providing individuals and
                  smaller institutions with the resources they need for artistic
                  production, programming, residencies, exhibitions, and much
                  more.

                  A major way to support the arts is to regularly attend
                  exhibitions and openings at your local galleries. However, as
                  many of us carry out social distancing measures during this
                  time, many arts institutions and galleries have moved their
                  exhibitions online through virtual galleries and online
                  viewing rooms. Showing up to an exhibition - even virtually -
                  can be a very cultural and educational experience. It also
                  goes a long way to showcase support to your fellow local
                  artists and arts community. Google Arts and Culture features
                  content from over 2,000 leading museums and galleries on their
                  platform. They have also partnered with various institutions
                  to showcase their exhibitions online, where you can even view
                  and virtually enter some of the most prestigious museums
                  around the world - right from your own living room. Check them
                  out here. Art fairs and festivals are even moving online, such
                  as the Virtual Design Festival. Launching on 15 April, this
                  will be the very first online architecture and design festival
                  that will include contributions from major designers,
                  instututions and brands around the world.
